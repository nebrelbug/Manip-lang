# manip
Manip is a pretty-single-paradigm mostly-string-manipulation programming language originally created by me just for fun. It is interpreted into JS by a single-file parser, and the syntax can be found in [syntax.md](syntax.md). It (I'm afraid) doesn't have many distinct features from other programming languages, but here are a few:

1. You can pass in parameters to variables
2. String manipulation is super easy
3. That's about it.

If you would be interested in contributing to Manip, contact via a comment, or post an issue. Since the language is not fully developed yet, it might not be super practical, though...

Soon to come: A Manip editor made with Electron! And NodeJS support. And a Package Manager. Eventually. Someday.
